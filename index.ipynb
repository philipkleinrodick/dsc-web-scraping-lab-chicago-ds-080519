In the end, you'll look to write a script that will iterate over all of the pages for the demo site and extract the title, price, star rating and availability of each book listed. Building up to that, you'll formalize the concepts from the lesson by writing functions that will extract a list of each of these features for each web page. You'll then combine these functions into the full script which will look something like this:  \n",
